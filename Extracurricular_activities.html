        <h2>Valuenteering work</h2>
        <li> Augustus 2023. <br>Valuenteering work Nepal
        </li>
        <ul>
            In August 2023, I volunteered in Nepal—a country that had always fascinated me with its mysterious landscapes and majestic mountains. This fascination was one of the reasons why I chose to volunteer at a local high school near Nagarkot. During my month-long stay, I taught children various subjects.
            <br>
            <br>
            Initially, I started teaching English, mathematics, and sciences such as physics. However, after a week, I realized that I could contribute more by teaching them about computers, especially since there was a computer lab available. Each day, I conducted classes for students of all ages on computer basics, including using Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. The younger pupils learned to draw in Paint, while I taught older students how to use basic mathematical functions in Excel.
            <br>
            <br>
            In return, I received a lot of appreciation and respect from the community. Overall, it was an amazing experience that taught me to appreciate the beauty of nature and the value of giving back.

        <h2>Business Hockey Event</h2>

        </li>
        <ul>
            BHE is a networking event.  In short, the BHE is a hockey tournament and networking event with the aim of connecting ambitious students and companies in the technical sector in an informal way. will consist of pitches by companies, several matches, a barbecue, and will conclude with a drinks reception. Half of the team will be employees from your company, and the other half will be selected students. We will match the students and companies based on their preferences, so that an ideal match between student and company is created. The students are final-year Bachelor or Master's degree students from various disciplines.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the Acquisition & Selection Commissioner within my committee, I was responsible for the initial phase of systematically contacting companies and ensuring that contracts were signed. In the second phase, the focus shifted to selecting specific students for companies, aiming to create ideal matches and informing companies in advance about the students they would host.

        <h2>First-year committee</h2> 
        <li> September 2017 — Augustus 2018. <br>S.V.Kybernetes First-year committee, Treasurer, Study association Kybernetes. Oktober 2022
        </li>
        <ul> As a member of the first-year committee, I took charge of organizing a weekend for first-year students in my Mechatronics program. This weekend served as an opportunity for students to connect with each other and become familiar with our new study environment. My primary responsibility was managing the finances for this event, ensuring there was adequate funding for various aspects such as food, accommodation, and activities.

            Through this experience, I learned the importance of collaboration with diverse stakeholders to prioritize student safety and create an enjoyable experience. Effective time management was also crucial as timely planning ensured that all necessary arrangements were in place, preventing any last-minute issues or cancellations.
