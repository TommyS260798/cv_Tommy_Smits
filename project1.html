        <h2>Siemens</h2>
        <li> May 2022 — April 2024. <br> <br>I began working at siemens as an internship which followed in a graduation internship. This experience offered me a fresh perspective on the professional landscape, particularly due to the strong contrast between Siemens corporate environment and the hospitality setting of Horeca Sterk. Siemens is also a multinational, I remembered at the beginning I felt overwhelmed by the enormous amount of information that was presented to me.  <br> <br>
            During my internship I developed a dashboard for a prototype model bridge. Where I learned the basics of KPI’s and data visualisation. This is where I learned my passion for data driven service which ultimately lead my to peruse a study into Data Science. Once my internship was finished I immediately started my graduation project at Siemens.
            My graduation project was fixated on predictive maintenance. I developed a prototype model of a gear setting. <br> <br> With industrial supplies a made sure that the gears where spinning at such a rate that the gears would break within a short time. With the aid of multiple sensors I investigated where there where highest fluctuations between sensor data, before and after the gears broke. This data served as the cornerstone of my efforts to predict maintenance needs accurately, ensuring optimal functionality and usability of the gear settings.
            <br>
            <br>
            After completing my degree, I could pursue my career at Siemens and joined a new team which was based on data driven services. Within this team, several programmers were dedicated to developing software solutions for clients. Recognizing the importance of ensuring high-quality code and overall software improvement, the team conclude the necessity for a software tester. This is where I stepped in. My strengths in general laid in the fact that I have solid knowledge of programming. enabling me to effectively translate client requirements and assess their technical feasibility within the software framework. And the other way around, is the newly implemented code was correctly implemented. <br> <br>
            My accountabilities of testing where regression testing. Regression testing is a manner of testing that evaluate whether a system meets the specified requirements and is acceptable for delivery to end users. This ensures that the software aligns with user expectations, identifies any discrepancies between the expected and actual system behaviour, this also provides confidence in the system’s readiness for production. <br> <br> 
            Since I was new in the testing scene I had to learn from the ground up. Therefore I first started with manual testing. A bug or improvement is reported I wrote a test script how this bug can be tested, ensuring thorough examination. Then when the developers solved the issue I used my test script and tested as a user if this issue is still present or not. <br> <br>
            Gradually, I became more profound in manual testing and started to investigate how to automate these test. This started of with python and a library called Selenium, I was able to write some testcases. While these automated tests provided efficiency, they often required extensive maintenance and weren't consistently accurate. Therefore, I got the opportunity to discuss my issues with a software test team at Mendix. Mendix is a low code platform, which was also used to create all the software made by the developers. These meetings helped to build a stable foundation for the test environment in the team. After some research and discussion, I eventually advised to continue with ROBOT framework. Eventually, I was able to conduct tests on ROBOT framework that are used with every update of the project. These tests are stored on a virtual machine environment where with a CI/CD pipeline. Where I also played a role in setting up and maintaining. A sample of my programming learnings can be found in my

            However, by the end of April 2024, my focus shifted as I embarked on my graduation project, demanding my undivided attention. Regrettably, this necessitated my departure from Siemens, concluding my employment with the company.<br> <br>
            The key points I learned while working at Siemens:
            <ul>
                <li><a>Software development</a></li>
                <li><a>Client and developer mediator</a></li>
                <li><a>Progressive work attitude</a></li>
                <li><a>Cross functional collaboration </a></li>
            </ul>
            
        </li>

        <h2>Horeca Sterk</h2>
        <li> June 2013 — December 2021. <br><br>During my time at Horeca Sterk, I embraced a multitude of responsibilities, and a high variety of duties from bartending at a community centre to catering services at a local swimming pool, and operating a food truck rented out for parties. Under the guidance of a business-savvy employer, I witnessed the growth and turning new ideas into work. <br> <br> 
            Initially, Horeca Sterk operated in two swimming pools at a community centre, and during the winter months, two food trucks specializing in the sale of Dutch delicacies like deep-fried dough balls ("oliebol"). However, as time progressed, these operations gradually phased out, making way for a focus on food truck services at events and gatherings. <br> <br> This transition also afforded me the unique opportunity to obtain a special driving license (BE), enabling me to drive the food trucks to their locations. That part of the job was especially joyful given my passion for driving and automobiles.<br> <br>
            With the evolution of my role came more responsibilities. I found myself entrusted with tasks such as schedule management, customer interactions, and the training and guidance of new colleagues.<br> <br> Working within the dynamics of a small business provided opportunities for personal development. I learned the importance of customer support, adeptly addressing any concerns or feedback they may have. <br> <br> 
            Operating within the realm of event catering also taught me invaluable lessons in navigating high-pressure situations. From dealing with unexpected events like fixing a flat tire on the spot to ensuring fast and save arrival at customer locations, each day presented its own set of challenges. <br> <br>
            Overall, my time at Horeca Sterk was immensely fulfilling. Eventually I had topursue an internship with  an company.

        <h2>Numerous jobs</h2>
        
        <li> 2011 - 2015. <br><br>
            During my childhood I engaged in a variety of jobs, each offering unique lessons and experiences. Starting as a paperboy and dishwasher in a small local bistro. <br> <br> During my time in secondary school, I found myself tutoring first-year pupils, leveraging my bilingual education to offer guidance in English while excelling in exacting subjects like physics and mathematics. <br> <br>
            In the summer of 2016, I began a summer adventure at a camping site in Belgium. There, I helped in the kitchen, where my passion of cooking started. I also helped and served as a contact person for reception duties. <br> <br> 
            These experience helped me to understand the importance of planning, responsibility, and respect for the work environment from an early age.
